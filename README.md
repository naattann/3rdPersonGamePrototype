# 3rdPersonGamePrototype

Scenes and Scripts for 3rd person hack and slash action game. The development of the project is in progress thus, it is messy. 
All of the scripts created by me has been attached independent of unity packages to ease revision process. Project scenes are uploaded as unity packages
due to very high size of main project file as a result of high amount of assets prepared for further steps of the game design.
